	<h2>Sudoku Editor</h2>
	<p>
	It's one of my two years diploma project, a Sudoku editor and solver. It doesn't generate grids but you can edit and ask it to help you to resolve them.
	This was clearly my first JAVA desktop application using SWING framework. We were two people involved in the development and now with some return of 
	experience I'm impressed of the pro aspect of the result.
