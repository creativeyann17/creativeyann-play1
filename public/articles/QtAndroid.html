	<h2>Qt Android</h2>
	<p>
	One framework I really like even if I don't use it a lot is Qt. Since some version it's possible to create a Qt UI program and deploy it on Android device.
	This is my test to validate the possibility to do it and I was really surprise. One important point is you need Qt libraries install on your device.
	You can do by packaging them inside the binary or installed them on your device, this way they are shared for all Qt applications.
