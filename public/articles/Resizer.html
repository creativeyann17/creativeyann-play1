		<h2>Resizer (concurrent)</h2>
		<p>
		It was the beginning of this year (2014) in holiday and after my return I had some photos to send to family.
		This is a topical case that everybody experienced one times in his life: resizing the photos, which are in HD, to 
		smaller definition like width around 800 or 1000; This time I decide to put my concurrent knowledge of JAVA 7
		ForkJoin framework in practice with a real use case: develop a concurrent photo resizer, and I have done it!
		</p>
		
		<h4>Technical aspect</h4>
		<p>
		The concept is simple, there are 2x folder one called "input" where you put the pack of photos and another called "output"
		where the resized pictures will be generated. The program detect the amount of available processors during the process.
		You can try by hand to change the variable THREADS to 1 to see the difference.
