	<h2>ShipBattle C#</h2>
	<p>
	Another student project in C# this times. The concept is simple: develop a ship battle like you want, just impress the teacher. I'm not a C# fan, for me it's a JAVA copy, but 
	nevertheless when Microsoft do something it's well done! Even today C# is very performant, maybe I should invest some time for it. Anyway I have done something
	amazing with multiplayer, AI, some 3D images to make the game more immersive (Blender) and homemade sounds for missed/succeed hits!
